# Selectra Technical Challenge

This is my input for the Technical Challenge

The code is located in /rails_app and is written in Ruby on Rails 5.1

In part 1 I was abble to go all the way to level 5 without any problem. As for the 6th level I do not get the same values.

In part 2 I chose to use Python for the CLI tool for multiple reasons. The first one is that Python is very efficient for this. I was able to start my project very quickly.
I also chose Python because it is a widespread language and easy to read.

## To start the app

- Go to rails_app
- In a terminal enter `bundle install`
- Start the server with `rails s`
- To communicate with the API go to `http://localhost:3000/`

## To use the CLI tool

- Download Python
- Install `requests` with `pip install requests`
- Run cli_tool/Main.py
