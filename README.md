# Selectra Technical Challenge

This is my input for the Technical Challenge

The code is located in /rails_app and is written in Ruby on Rails 5.1

In part 1 I was abble to go all the way to level 5 without any problem. As for the 6th level I do not get the same values.

As for the moment I haven't started part 2.

## To start the app

-Go to rails_app
-In a terminal enter `bundle install`
-Start the server with `rails s`
-To communicate with the API go to `http://localhost:3000/`
